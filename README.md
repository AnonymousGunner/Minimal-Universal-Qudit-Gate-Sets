# Minimal-Universal-Multi-Qudit-Gate-Sets
The code repository alligns with the research paper titled "Practically Implementable Minimal Universal Gate Sets for Multi-Qudit Systems with Cryptographic Validation".

## 1. Introduction

This repository provides a practical implementation and validation framework for a minimal universal gate set for multi-qudit systems. 
It aligns with the paper titled "Practically Implementable Minimal Universal Gate Sets for Multi-Qudit Systems with Cryptographic Validation". 
Unlike generic qubit circuits, qudit circuits leverage higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. 
Here we validate two cryptographically significant algorithms: **Grover's search** and **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**. 
Both implementations are constructed with traditional gates and with decomposed gates synthesized entirely from the universal set `PHASE1 ∪ T_elements`. 
The aim is to confirm functional equivalence and assess performance trade-offs, thereby demonstrating that qudit-based circuits can be realistically deployed for cryptographic applications.

## 4. Grover’s Algorithm Validation

### Traditional Circuit

Constructed with generalized qudit gates:  

```python
circuit = cirq.Circuit([
    QuditHGate(d=4)(q0),
    QuditHGate(d=4)(q1),
    UfGate()(q0,q1),
    QuditHGate(d=4)(q0),
    QuditHGate(d=4)(q1),
    U0Gate()(q0,q1),
    QuditHGate(d=4)(q0),
    QuditHGate(d=4)(q1),
    cirq.measure(q0, q1)
])
```

### Universal Circuit

Constructed using Reck’s decomposition:  

```python
H_unitary = QuditHGate(d=4)._unitary_()
R_matrices, Phi = reckon_decompose_unitary(H_unitary)
ops = [ArbitraryGate(d=4, matrix=Phi)(q0), ArbitraryGate(d=4, matrix=Phi)(q1)]
for M in R_matrices[::-1]:
    ops += [ArbitraryGate(d=4, matrix=M)(q0), ArbitraryGate(d=4, matrix=M)(q1)]
```

### Results

- **Traditional Histogram**  
  ![Grover Traditional](./Grover_Measurements/Grovers%20Circuit%20with%20Traditional%20Gates.png)  

- **Universal Histogram**  
  ![Grover Universal](./Grover_Measurements/Grovers%20Circuit%20with%20Universal%20Gates.png)  

**Interpretation:** Both amplify the same marked state, confirming equivalence.  
The universal version has greater depth but functional correctness is preserved.  

## 5. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Validation

- Alice chooses random trit (0/1/2) and basis (rectilinear/diagonal).  
- Bob chooses random basis (rectilinear/diagonal).  
- Keys established when bases align.  

### Basis Choice Distribution

### Example Logs  

```
--- QKD Round 29/100 ---
Alice: Preparing bit 2 in basis 'diagonal'.
Bob: Choosing basis 'diagonal'.
0(d=3): --- Qutrit_0swap2_Gate --- Qu3H --- Qu3H --- M('diagonal_measurement')
0(d=3): --- Qu3M x3 --- Qu3M x5 --- Qu3M x5 --- M('diagonal_measurement')
Bob: Measured bit 2 in basis 'diagonal'.
Bob: Measured bit 2 in basis 'diagonal'.
Alice and Bob used the same basis.
Key established for this round: 2
```

In Round 29 of the QKD simulation, within the traditional setup, Alice randomly selected the trit “2” and the diagonal basis, while Bob independently chose the same diagonal basis. On Alice’s side, this resulted in a circuit beginning with the 0swap2 gate to encode the symbol, followed by a Hadamard gate to realize the diagonal basis. Bob, matching the basis choice, appended a Hadamard gate before measurement. 
In case of universal decomposed gates, all the gates are decomposed into unitary matrices of the proposed forms and then appended subsequently replacing the traditional gates. The 0swap2 gate has been replaced with one R_ij, one Phi balance and one Phi matrices, while the Hadamard gate has been replaced with three R_ij, one Phi balance and one Phi matrices.
Both measurements yielded the value “2”, and since the bases aligned, a key bit was successfully established, exactly as predicted by the principles of QKD.


```
--- QKD Round 67/100 ---
Alice: Preparing bit 0 in basis 'rectilinear'.
Bob: Choosing basis 'diagonal'.
20 Anonymous Submission
0(d=3): --- Qu3H --- M('rectilinear_measurement')
0(d=3): --- Qu3M --- Qu3M --- Qu3M --- Qu3M --- Qu3M --- M('diagonal_measurement')
Bob: Measured bit 1 in basis 'diagonal'.
Bob: Measured bit 2 in basis 'diagonal'.
Alice and Bob used different bases or measurement result invalid.
No key bit established for this round.
```

In Round 67 of the QKD simulation, within the traditional setup, Alice randomly selected the trit “0” and the rectilinear basis, while Bob independently chose the diagonal basis. Because of Alice’s choices, this resulted in a circuit that keeps the state unaltered. Bob, matching the basis choice, appended a Hadamard gate before measurement. 
In case of universal decomposed gates, the only Hadamard gate in the circuit has been replaced with three R_ij, one Phi balance and one Phi matrices. We see both measurements yielded different values of measured bit, although the choice of bases being different, this round will anyway not yield any shared key bit.

### Summary  

- 100 rounds simulated.  
- Around 50 shared key bits established.  
- Both traditional and universal gates produced identical outcomes whenever choices of bases matches.  

## 6. Implementation Details

- **Reck’s decomposition** expresses arbitrary unitaries as products of 2×2 rotations and a diagonal phase.  
- Custom Cirq gates (`QuditHGate`, `Qutrit_0swap1`, `Qutrit_0swap2`) are decomposed into `ArbitraryGate` instances.  
- Circuits use `cirq.LineQid` with dimension=3 (QKD) or 4 (Grover).  
- Outputs:  
  - Histograms (`Matplotlib`)  
  - Logs (plain text)
